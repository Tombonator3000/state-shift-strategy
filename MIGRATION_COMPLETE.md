# MVP Migration Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully migrated existing card database to MVP format.

## What Was Done

### 1. Card Type Conversion
- **DEFENSIVE → MEDIA**: All defensive cards converted to media cards
- **ATTACK → ATTACK**: Preserved with cleaned effects
- **MEDIA → MEDIA**: Preserved with cleaned effects  
- **ZONE → ZONE**: Preserved with cleaned effects

### 2. Cost Standardization
Applied MVP cost table (Type × Rarity):

| Type | Common | Uncommon | Rare | Legendary |
|------|--------|----------|------|-----------|
| ATTACK | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| MEDIA | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| ZONE | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

### 3. Effect Cleaning
**Allowed effects per type:**
- **ATTACK**: `ipDelta.opponent` (>0), optional `discardOpponent` (0-2)
- **MEDIA**: `truthDelta` (can be ± value)
- **ZONE**: `pressureDelta` (>0, requires targetStateId when playing)

**Dropped effects**: All non-MVP effects removed (reactions, conditionals, etc.)

### 4. Files Updated
- `src/data/core/mvp-cards.ts` - Now imports migrated cards
- `src/data/core/migrate-and-replace.ts` - Migration execution file
- Card database now uses all your original cards with MVP format

## Original Cards Preserved
