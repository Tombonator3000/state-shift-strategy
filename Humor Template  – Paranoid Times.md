3. Writing Rules
Flavor Lines

Government: One-line bureaucratic denial or procedure. Always deadpan.

Truth: One-line tabloid claim or witness quote. Always exaggerated.

Images

Always: 1990s black-and-white grainy newsprint.

Government: “Boring official setting” + absurd detail hidden/ignored.

Truth: “Amateur snapshot” + absurdity at center stage.

Headlines

Use verbs first, big caps.

Government = euphemism/cover-up.

Truth = scandal/explosion.

4. Running Gags

Recurring Figures: Florida Man, Bat Boy, Elvis, Bigfoot, lizard people in suits.

Repetition Jokes: “No anomalies detected” stamped on increasingly absurd photos.

Cover vs. Reveal: Every Government card is covering up, every Truth card is revealing.

📰 Humor Style Bible – Paranoid Times
🎯 Purpose

This guide ensures every card, headline, and flavor line in Paranoid Times hits the same comedic tone:

Government = boring, bureaucratic, official — but obviously covering up aliens, cryptids, Elvis, lizard people.

Truth Seekers = chaotic, amateur tabloids — screaming headlines, blurry photos, and “groundbreaking” proof nobody asked for.

🏛 Government Humor (Cover-Up Comedy)

Core Rule:
The Government never admits the absurdity. They always treat it as paperwork, procedure, or “no anomalies detected.”

Writing Patterns

Official Stamp: “APPROVED,” “DENIED,” “DELAYED.”

Committee Speak: “Filed under Section 12-C.”

Bureaucratic Euphemism: “Routine debris retrieval.”

Deadpan Contrast: Something ridiculous is happening, but the description treats it as normal.

Sample Flavor Lines

“Filed, stamped, and archived. Nothing unusual.”

“Routine retrieval, catalogued as ‘balloon fragments.’”

“Minutes recorded. Hissing ignored.”

“Pending review under Subsection 12-C.”

“Budget reallocation approved. Recipient: Unknown.”

“Photographic evidence sealed indefinitely.”

“FOIA request delayed — for your safety.”

“Integration program proceeding smoothly.”

“All signatures verified, despite claws.”

“Meeting adjourned at 14:37 sharp.”

🔍 Truth Seeker Humor (Amateur Revelation)

Truth Seekers are excited amateurs. Everything is a scandal, a scoop, a shocking discovery. Their proof is always grainy, misinterpreted, or overblown.

Big Tabloid Headlines: “ALIENS CRASH WEDDING!”

Excited Quotes: “It winked at me, I swear!”

DIY Journalism: flyers, Polaroids, VHS footage.

Social Media Energy (before social media): “Goes Viral,” “Shocks the Nation,” “What They Don’t Want You To See!”

“I swear, it waved back.”

“They never left. They just changed disguises.”

“She brought a ring light. The monster brought receipts.”

“The sheriff took notes. The cows went up.”

“Finally! Proof they can’t deny. Unless they do.”
