## 6. Turn Structure

- Draw until hand = 5 cards (if possible).  
- Gain +5 base IP + IP from states owned.  

**Action Phase**  
- Play up to 3 cards, paying IP cost.  
- **ATTACK** triggers Defense reaction:  
  - Opponent may play 1 DEFENSIVE within 4s.  
  - If none, Attack resolves.  

**Resolution**  
- Apply card effects.  
- ZONE captures are immediate (Pressure ≥ Defense).  

**Newspaper Phase**  
- Satirical overlay with plays + 1 random event.  

**Victory Check**
