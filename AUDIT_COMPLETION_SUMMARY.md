- **Proper lifecycle: Hand ‚Üí Play ‚Üí Discard**
- **Both human and AI follow same card flow rules**

### 4. **STATE SYNCHRONIZATION** - ‚úÖ IMPROVED
- **Engine state conversion now correctly maps existing discard piles**
- **No more temporary/fake discard arrays**
- **UI and engine states stay synchronized**

## üî• REMAINING HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 5. **AUDIO SYSTEM** - ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS FIX
