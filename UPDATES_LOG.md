# Updates Log

This document provides a chronological record of gameplay-impacting changes merged into State Shift Strategy. Each entry should include the merge date and a brief, human-readable summary so future contributors can quickly understand how the game has evolved.

## 2025-10-05 – Guard difficulty storage access
- Use the safe localStorage helpers for difficulty reads and writes so blocked storage falls back to the NORMAL difficulty without crashing callers.

## 2025-10-05 – Harden options storage reads
- Use the safe localStorage helper when loading saved options so the game falls back to defaults when storage is unavailable.

## 2025-10-05 – Harden tutorial progress storage
- Ensure the tutorial manager uses safe localStorage helpers so blocked storage falls back to in-memory defaults without breaking onboarding.
- Wrap tutorial reset logic in guards so clearing progress never crashes when storage access fails.

## 2025-10-05 – Harden onboarding storage writes
- Use the safe localStorage setter for onboarding completion and skip flags so the tutorial still dismisses when storage access is blocked and logs a warning when persistence fails.

## 2025-10-05 – Index onboarding storage safeguards
- Use the safe storage helpers for faction selection, IP tracking, and onboarding checks so the intro flow still works when localStorage is blocked.

## 2025-10-05 – Weather badge storage safety
- Use the safe localStorage helper for the start screen weather badge so blocked storage no longer breaks the intro UI.

## 2025-10-05 – Stabilize discard toggling during menus
- Move the discard hook and related gating logic before intro/menu early returns so switching between intro and menu no longer triggers React hook order errors.

## 2025-10-05 – Harden local storage fallbacks
- Guard settings and faction persistence against blocked storage so new games keep default options without crashing.
- Add helper coverage to verify localStorage failures resolve safely.

## 2025-10-05 – Safeguard AI zone plays without targets
- Prevent the AI from resolving zone cards that lack a valid target state and add regression coverage to keep turns flowing.

## 2025-10-05 – Planned discard feature
- Track the upcoming discard mechanic update so we remember to document its implementation details when the feature ships.
