## How to Use This Book

This is a hybrid **in-universe sourcebook** (90%) with occasional **out-of-character designer sidebars** (10%). Read it as if all tabloids were right all along. The tone mixes pulp satire with straight-faced analysis, so you can run it as a comedic romp, a spooky X-Files thriller, or both in the same session.

**Core pillars (for GMs/designers):**

- **Everything is true.** If it ever headlined a tabloid, it exists somewhere in this setting.  
- **Humor meets horror.** Keep the energy playful even when things get dark.  
- **Paranoia as play.** Conspiracies are a canvas for fun, not real-world harm.  
- **Satire with heart.** Use the absurd to mirror reality, not to punch down.

## 1. Welcome to the Paranoid Times Universe

Imagine our world viewed through a tabloid lens: **every wild headline is canon**. UFOs cut neat circles in wheat. Government briefings redact every third word. A hairy giant steals your beef jerky at a trailhead and leaves a perfect size-22 footprint. Ghosts slam doors at 3 a.m., and a well-pressed **Man in Black** rings your bell at 3:01.

**Rules of reality (approximate):**

- Coincidences are **operations** with better PR.  
- Technology is **ten years ahead** of the press release; thirty ahead in underground labs.  
- Magic is **finicky science** powered by attention, geometry, and deadlines.  
- If you doubt it long enough, a **classified memo** will confirm it.  

**Player fantasy:** ordinary people who pull a red string on the corkboard and watch the world unravel into something hilarious and terrifying — and fixable.

## 2. Factions & Editors (Power Blocks)

### Illuminati & The Council of the Unseen

The champagne-pyramid atop the pyramid. Thirteen seats (give or take a reptile). They auction reality at airports with suspicious murals. Their tools: **front orgs**, ritual optics, predictive markets, and **ubiquitous surveillance**. Their goal: a benevolent **New World Order** (benevolent for them).

**Hooks:**

- Bid wars at Davos determine weather patterns next quarter.  
- A Council seat sits empty: was the previous occupant… disintegrated by a portal?  

**Designer Note:** Use Illuminati as big-picture pressure, not constant villains.

---

### The Government’s Shadow Directorates

MJ-12, Office X, Section 51, the Custodians—every country has one. They **sanitize scenes, seize evidence, and seed doubt**.

**Methods:**

- Plausible cover stories (“drone exercise,” “bear on hind legs,” “art project”).  
- First-responder privilege: arrive, bag, tag, vanish.  
- Relocation packages for inconvenient witnesses (lifetime all-inclusive cul-de-sac).  
- The occasional tragic “accident.”  

**Hooks:**

- A FOIA request returns 700 pages of black ink and one intern’s coffee ring that maps to a base.

---

### Men in Black (MIB)

Tailored dread. Off-the-rack smiles. Either government contractors, miscalibrated androids, or aliens play-acting as humans with patchy firmware.

**Vibe:** polite threats, faulty small talk, impossible exits.

**Sample encounter:** They hand you a box labeled “DO NOT OPEN.” Inside is a note: **“Thank you for not opening.”** The box is heavier afterward.

---

### Truth Seekers & Tabloid Press

Bloggers with burner phones, earnest Forteans, ghost-hunters with cracked EMF meters, and **rabidly underfunded** reporters who occasionally hit the bullseye.

**Motivations:** curiosity, spite, pattern hunger, justice, clicks.  

**Play as:** your party. Journalists at *The Paranoid Times*, a chaotic forum collective, or a field team bankrolled by a mysterious auntie who “just wants to see what’s out there.”

**Tabloid sidebar:**

> **BIGFOOT LIVES DOWNTOWN — WEARING A COAT!**  
> *Local claims a 2.5-meter “man” with wet-dog aroma is camping in the park. Authorities discovered huge prints around an abandoned sleeping bag. The coat was a tarp.*

---

### Cults, Sects, and Credo-Industrial Complex

From Venusian love communes to Mothman vigils. Some channel real forces, others LARP their way into catastrophic leverage.

**Examples:**

- **Children of the Cosmos:** actual contact at a desert ridge. Message unclear; merchandising strong.  
- **Apocalypse LLC:** false flag factories in service of Order Through Panic™.  
- **Lodge XXIII:** nice aprons, real rites, unwise summons.  

---

### Alien Stakeholders

Multiple species, clashing agendas:

- **The Greys (Zeta Reticulans):** abductors with biotech woes. Contractual partners to agencies. Good at memory edits, bad at bedside manner.  
- **Reptilians:** predators in human skinsuits. Some sit on the Council; others prefer throne rooms under volcanoes.  
- **Nordics:** benevolent space-Swedes with inconvenient truths and perfect jawlines. Whisper to chosen contactees.  
- **Martians & Venusians:** remnants of old inner-system cultures; mostly offworld now.  
- **Oddities:** insectoids, light-beings, and interdimensionals who confuse demons with firmware updates.  

**Conflict web:** Reptilians vs Nordics (ideology); Greys vs Nordics (ethics); Everyone vs Everyone on Tuesdays.

---

## 3. Bestiary of the Unexplained (Cryptids & Company)

### Bigfoot & Kin

A people, not a mascot. Woodland hominins with family groups, tool use, and **boundary-setting**. Generally peaceful unless cornered.

**Field signs:** tree knocks, braid patterns on horse manes, bacon theft.

**GM Use:** witness protectors, reluctant allies, or midnight silhouettes.

---

### Lake & Sea Monsters

Nessie, Champ, Selma, and cousins. Not extinct — just **excellent at hide-and-seek**. Deep tunnels, sonar-dodging bladders, generational memory.

**At sea:** giant cephalopods with opinions about ships.

---

### Mothman

Winged omen or disaster catalyst. Red eyes, 3 a.m. visits, scanner-frying presence.

**Cult:** expects warnings; receives dread.  
**GM Use:** foreshadowing engine; moral ambiguity dispenser.

---

### Chupacabra

Hedgehog-meets-lizard bloodsucker. Lab “escapee” or evolutionary prank. Livestock fear it; tabloids adore it.

---

### Also Appearing

Thunderbirds, Jersey Devil, hollow-earth fauna, and **Bat Boy** — now “Bat Man,” Appalachian folk hero with a zine.

---

## 4. Spirits, Sorcery & The Polite Supernatural

Ghosts loop tragedies; cursed dolls ruin AirBnBs; certain rites **work** (on Thursdays). Churches keep quiet exorcist teams; agencies keep quieter ones.

**Designer Note:** Treat magic as capricious engineering — rules exist, but leaks and patches keep them fun.

---

## 5. Sites of Interest (Go There; Regret It)

- **Area 51:** aircraft testbed plus alien garage.  
- **Dulce Base:** multi-species R&D nightmare.  
- **Cheyenne Mountain:** tracks everything that flies; labels most of it “weather.”  
- **Pine Gap:** southern hemisphere’s listening post.  
- **Antarctica:** something geometric under Vostok ice said hello once.  
- **Bermuda Triangle:** packet loss for reality.  
- **Leyline Hubs:** Stonehenge, Giza, Nazca.  
- **Corn Circle Country:** genuine messages sprinkled among prankster art.

---

## 9. Everyday Life (Paranoia, Lite)

People commute, binge shows, and ignore the weird unless it kicks their shins. Police paperwork forbids “UFO”; acceptable: “unlicensed aerial phenomenon.” Smart homes eavesdrop.

**Street Scenes:**

- Grandma foils windows.  
- Neighborhood watch flips between coyotes and reptile alerts.  

---

## 10. Running Paranoid Times (GM Section)

**Tone Dial:** Camp ←——→ Cold Fear. Switch mid-scene; humor is a pressure valve.

- **Ghost in the Server:** haunted mainframe leaks files.  
- **Bat Boy’s Amnesty:** safe haven diplomacy.  
- **The Friendly Nordic:** a contactee vanishes.  

**Mechanics Agnostic:** Treat **Truth** and **Cover-Up** as scene meters.

**Safety Tools:** Use consent tools (X-card, Lines & Veils).

---

## 11. Designer Marginalia (Out-of-Character)

- **Why satire?** Distance for heavy ideas.  
- **Why “everything is true”?** Collapses debate; opens play.  
- **How to keep it fresh?** Rotate spotlight (aliens → ghosts → cryptids → cults → corporate).  
- **Power ceiling:** let PCs win sometimes.

---
