# Audio System - Sound Effects Integration Guide

## Current Status

The game's audio system is fully functional with the following sound effects:

### âœ… Working Sound Effects
- **UI Sounds**: click, hover, lightClick, error
- **Gameplay**: cardPlay, cardDraw, turnEnd, newspaper, stateCapture
- **Music**: victory, defeat, typewriter
- **Background Music**: Theme, Government, Truth, End Credits tracks

### ðŸ”„ Paranormal Effects (Using Fallbacks)
The following paranormal sound effects are currently using existing sounds as placeholders:

- **`ufo-elvis`** â†’ Using background music (for UFO/Elvis broadcasts)
- **`cryptid-rumble`** â†’ Using defeat sound (for cryptid encounters) 
- **`radio-static`** â†’ Using typewriter sound (for radio interference)

## Adding Proper Paranormal Sound Effects

To replace the fallback sounds with proper paranormal audio:

### 1. Find Free Sound Effects

### 4. Installation
Place the downloaded files in `public/audio/` with these exact names:
```
public/audio/ufo-elvis.mp3      # UFO/alien broadcast sound
public/audio/radio-static.mp3   # Radio interference/static

```

### 5. Testing
Use the in-game audio controls (settings gear icon) to:
- Test each sound effect individually
- Verify volume levels
- Check that paranormal sounds trigger properly

## Current Fallback Mapping

Until proper sounds are added, the system uses:

```javascript
'ufo-elvis': '/audio/Background-music.mp3',      // â†’ Proper alien/UFO sound needed
'cryptid-rumble': '/audio/defeat.mp3',          // â†’ Deep rumble/earthquake needed  
'radio-static': '/audio/typewriter.mp3'         // â†’ Radio static/interference needed
```

## When Sounds Are Added

The audio system will automatically:
1. Detect the new files on next page load
2. Replace fallback sounds with proper effects
3. Show "âœ… Loaded" status in audio controls
4. Play authentic paranormal sounds during gameplay

## License Compliance
