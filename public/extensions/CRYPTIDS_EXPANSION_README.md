# Cryptids Expansion — README

## 1. Overview
The **Cryptids Expansion** brings folklore, legendary beasts, and tabloid absurdism into *ShadowGov*.  
Players encounter Bigfoot, Mothman, Chupacabra, Nessie, the Jersey Devil, and more — always framed through the game’s satirical Government vs. Truth struggle.

- **Faction split**:  
  - Truth = chaotic revelations, blurry photos, DIY proof.  
  - Government = dry denials, bureaucratic cover-ups, “no anomalies detected.”  
- **Card types**: Still only ATTACK / MEDIA / ZONE (MVP whitelist).  
- **Style**: 1990s black-and-white tabloid grain, disposable camera snapshots (Truth) vs. official reports (Government).  
- **Flavor**: Blends conspiracy humor, running gags (Florida Man, Bat Boy, Elvis, Bigfoot), and absurd witness quotes.

---

## 2. Design Goals
- Expand the **flavor space** without breaking MVP balance.  
- Add **iconic cryptid figures** as both cards and running gags.  
- Introduce **Zone-locations** themed around cryptid folklore hotspots.  
- Provide **synergy combos** (soft bonuses + newspaper headlines) for thematic card pairs.  
- Support **Homestate bonuses**: small boosts when cryptids appear in their “natural” states.  
- Plug directly into the **newspaper engine** (mastheads, ads, headlines).

---

## 3. Components
- ~200 new cards (balanced to MVP rarity & cost tables).  
- ATTACK = exposés, leaks, chaos (IP drain).  
- MEDIA = viral proof, tabloid reports (Truth swings).  
- ZONE = hotspots, haunted sites, rallies (Pressure).  
- Fully MVP-compliant JSON (`cryptids.json`).  
- New mastheads & ads integrated via `newspaperData.json`.

---

## 4. Humor & Style
- **Government Humor**: Boring procedure covering absurd events.  
  - “Filed under subsection 12-C. No anomalies.”  
  - “Operation successful. Crowd dispersed before noticing the lizard.”  
- **Truth Humor**: Amateur journalism, tabloid hype, chaotic witnesses.  
  - “Crowd chanted until Bigfoot waved back.”  
  - “Posted to six forums before breakfast.”  
- **Recurring Figures**: Florida Man, Bat Boy, Elvis, Bigfoot.  
- **Duality**: Same cryptid can appear as a Truth revelation and a Government cover-up.

## 5. Special Systems

### 5.1 Combo Effects
Expansion cards trigger **combo headlines** and small bonuses when played together.  
These are *cosmetic + soft buffs* only — no new mechanics outside MVP.

#### Example Combos
- **Bigfoot + Elvis** → Headline: “BIGFOOT BACKUP SINGER JOINS ELVIS RESURRECTION TOUR!” → +1 Pressure in chosen state.  
- **Bat Boy + Florida Man** → “BAT BOY AND FLORIDA MAN FORM POLITICAL PARTY — CHAOS ENSUES!” → Opponent discards 1 card.  
- **Cornfield Abduction** (UFO + Cornfield Zone) → “COWS ABDUCTED DURING COUNTY FAIR!” → +1 Truth.  
- **Mothman + MEDIA** → “MOTHMAN PREDICTS DOOM — NARRATIVE SWINGS WILDLY!” → TruthDelta doubled (this turn).  
- **Cryptid Congress** (Bigfoot + Nessie + Chupacabra) → “CRYPTIDS FORM SHADOW CONGRESS!” → +2 Pressure in one state.

👉 Full combo table: see Appendix A.

---

### 5.2 Homestate Bonuses
Each major cryptid is linked to one or more states. Playing a ZONE/ATTACK/MEDIA card in that state triggers a small bonus if the matching cryptid card is on hand or in play.

#### Example Homestate Bonuses
- **Bigfoot** (WA/OR) → +1 Pressure when playing ZONE there.  
- **Mothman** (WV) → +1 Truth from MEDIA played in WV.  
- **Chupacabra** (TX/NM/AZ) → ATTACK drains +1 IP.  
- **Jersey Devil** (NJ) → +1 Pressure on ZONE in NJ.  
- **Skunk Ape** (FL) → ATTACK in FL drains +1 IP.  
- **Wendigo** (MN/MI/WI) → ATTACK in those states forces 1 discard.  

👉 Full homestate table: see Appendix B.

---

## 6. Integration
- **Rules**: Expansion remains within MVP whitelist (truthDelta, ipDelta, pressureDelta).  
- **Engine**: Homestate + combo systems run as optional layers in `StoryBanks.ts`.  
- **UI**: Newspaper generator uses expansion-specific headlines, ads, and mastheads:  
  - “Bigfoot Bulletin”, “Mothman Monthly”, “Zombie Zone Zine”.  
- **Data**: JSON card files validated by sanitiser (costs auto-match rarity).

---
