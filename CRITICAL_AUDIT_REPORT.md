# CRITICAL AUDIT REPORT - ShadowGov Game

## üö® CRITICAL BUILD ERRORS (BLOCKING)

### 1. TYPE SYSTEM CONFLICT - GameState Mismatch
**Location:** `src/pages/Index.tsx` lines 102, 106, 111
**Issue:** Accessing `gameState.discard` and `gameState.aiDiscard` that don't exist
**Impact:** Build fails, game won't compile

**Root Cause:** Two incompatible GameState interfaces:
- Engine GameState (has discard piles)
- UI GameState (missing discard piles)

### 2. MISSING DISCARD PILE FUNCTIONALITY
**Issue:** No persistent discard tracking in UI state
**Impact:** Cards disappear but don't go anywhere, breaking card flow

## üî• HIGH PRIORITY BUGS

### 3. CARD FLOW BROKEN
- Cards removed from hand but not added to discard
- No way to track what cards were played
- Engine expects discard piles for proper game mechanics

### 4. STATE SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUES
- `useRuleEngine` conversion creates temporary discard arrays
- Changes don't persist back to UI state
- Dual state management causing desync

### 5. AUDIO SYSTEM FAILURES
- Multiple audio files failing to load
- All `/audio/` and `/muzak/` files returning 404-like errors
- Game audio completely broken

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 6. TYPE SAFETY VIOLATIONS
- Multiple `any` types in card processing
- Missing proper interfaces for card effects
- Inconsistent type usage across components

### 7. PERFORMANCE CONCERNS
- Large file sizes (useGameState.ts: 1197 lines, useRuleEngine.ts: 250 lines)
- Complex nested state updates
- Potential memory leaks in audio context

### 8. CODE ARCHITECTURE PROBLEMS
- Massive monolithic components
- Tight coupling between UI and game logic
- Duplicate GameState definitions

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE FIX PLAN

### PHASE 1: CRITICAL FIXES (Build Errors)
1. **Unify GameState Interface** - Add discard piles to UI GameState
2. **Fix Index.tsx** - Update discard pile access to use correct properties
3. **Implement Discard Flow** - Cards go from hand ‚Üí discard when played

### PHASE 2: CORE FUNCTIONALITY
4. **Fix Audio System** - Resolve audio file loading issues
5. **Engine-UI Sync** - Proper state synchronization between engine and UI
6. **Card Flow Validation** - Ensure cards move through lifecycle correctly

### PHASE 3: ARCHITECTURE CLEANUP
7. **Refactor Large Files** - Break down monolithic components
8. **Type Safety** - Add proper TypeScript interfaces
9. **Performance Optimization** - Reduce re-renders and improve efficiency

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Game builds without TypeScript errors
- [ ] Cards properly move from hand to discard pile
- [ ] Audio system loads and plays sounds
- [ ] Engine state syncs with UI state
- [ ] No console errors during gameplay
- [ ] Card effects work as expected
